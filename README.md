### The aim of this project is to implement the K-means clustering algorithm using MLP neural networks.
### In the first step, we run the K-means clustering algorithm on the MNIST database with various parameters, including the simple mode you want to implement and examine the effect of changing each of these parameters on the performance of the algorithm. To evaluate performance, we use the Purity and Rand Index.
### In the next step, we want to implement the orphan algorithm using neural networks. To do this, we first compare the various features of the K-means algorithm with what we know about MLP networks and then try to find a solution to this problem. Also, note that clustering algorithms, such as K-means, operate unsupervised and do not require labels; Neural networks, on the other hand, need data labels to become the best. We also suggest a solution to solve this problem.
